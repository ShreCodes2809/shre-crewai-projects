After evaluating the investment potential of Broadcom, Zebra Technologies, and Procept BioRobotics based on their market positions, future outlooks, and growth trajectories, Broadcom emerges as the most promising investment opportunity. Here is the detailed report:

**Chosen Company: Broadcom (AVGO)**

1. **Market Position**: Broadcom maintains a dominant position in the semiconductor and infrastructure software sectors. The company is gaining significant market traction by focusing on the expanding AI chip market. It projects a 63% increase in AI chip sales to $19.9 billion by fiscal 2025, showcasing its competitive edge in securing market share against rivals.

2. **Future Outlook**: Broadcom has laid out strategic plans for robust growth through investments in AI chip manufacturing. With anticipated revenues from AI products projected to reach $60-$90 billion by fiscal 2027, and the construction of new facilities alongside AI partnerships, Broadcom's growth trajectory appears solid.

3. **Investment Potential**: The company's strong investor sentiment, highlighted by a nearly 60% surge in stock price due to elevated demand for its innovative products, underlines its lucrative potential. Broadcom is a standout candidate for investors focusing on a diversified tech portfolio with a keen interest in AI developments.

**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **Zebra Technologies (ZBRA)**: Although Zebra Technologies remains a leading player in the IoT sector with noted innovation in logistics and supply chains, its mixed market assessments and potential overvaluation present investment challenges. While projected to grow earnings by 16.1% annually, the risks associated with volatility in stock prices and overvaluation issues deter from making it the top choice.

2. **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)**: Procept BioRobotics offers compelling high-growth prospects within the robotic surgical solutions market. However, the substantial profit margin challenge at -30.6% and current profit difficulties pose major investment risks. The company's appeal is more for high-risk, high-reward-oriented investors.

In conclusion, Broadcom is selected as the optimal investment due to a combination of strong leadership in AI chip markets, promising revenue growth forecasts, and positive market sentiment, making it a highly desirable option for investors with a tech-oriented, growth-focused strategy.
